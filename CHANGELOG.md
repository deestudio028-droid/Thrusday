* **browser:** a waiting job's hidden browsers are looked at every five minutes, not on the hourly sweep ([3a30d27](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday-agent/commit/3a30d276b3b68a6b1ebf46b451051b3faa410287))

* **threads:** Settings › Threads searches on the server, so a word nothing matches costs one request ([0d5d070](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday-agent/commit/0d5d0704d5d1bac926fc3c55eb1ce7c42dfced0d))


### Under the hood
