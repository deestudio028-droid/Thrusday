# Skills and finished work

Every bot makes pages, canvases, decks, videos and reports with the same shipped
skills, and the user opens what they made in the app and edits a page, a deck or a canvas there.

## Start here
- `skills/README.md` — which folders are not skills, the script paths promised, outside copies.
- `features/skills/skills.discover.ts` — where skills are found, which one holds a name, a ready-made bot's kit, the old copies left unlisted.
- `features/ai/tools/skills.tool.ts` — `load_skill`: a skill's instructions and files.
- `skills/artifact/SKILL.md` — every kind the user keeps or uses, as one skill, its `runtime/` behind it; a sheet is a real .xlsx (`skills/artifact/scripts/spreadsheet.mjs`).
- `skills/artifact/runtime/shell/put.mjs` — how a bot writes into a page a skill made; the revision saves check.
- `features/ai/tools/deck.tool.ts` — `make_deck`: typed slides that `skills/artifact/runtime/deck` draws.
- `skills/artifact/scripts/deck.mjs` — a deck as a PDF, or a video reading its notes aloud.
- `skills/artifact/scripts/motion.mjs` — a motion video: the bot's code draws each scene with the kit in `runtime/motion` (`runtime/motion/film.js`, its kit `kit-*.js` and music `runtime/motion/score.js`), checked in a browser by `put`, rendered to mp4.
- `features/bot/bot.seed.ts` — the seed bots' roles, and what a role may name.
- `features/artifact/artifact.query.ts` — finished work, listed from the bots' folders alone.
- `app/api/file/[...path]/route.ts` — a workspace file served; a page runs on its own origin.

## How it fits
A job's shell names the bot's artifacts folder and the shipped skills (`botShellEnv` in
`features/workspace/workspace.ts`); `document.mjs` and `canvas.mjs` write there by
default, and `make_deck` runs `runtime/deck/deck.mjs` itself. All dress their one HTML file in the artifact
skill's `runtime/shell`, which `load_skill` never lists (`PATHS.skills.runtime`). The app lists
finished work from the folders, serves it through `app/api/file`, and frames a page in `FileFrame`
(`features/workspace/components/file-view.tsx`): a reader's edits go to `savePage`, a write while
it shows goes to the page as `changed`. A seed's own skills are read in place from
`seed-skills/<name>/`; older copies in bots' folders stay, unlisted (`seed-skills/retired.json`).

## What breaks
- A motion film's tears are seeded by the order of draw calls (`X.n`, `runtime/motion/kit-core.js`):
  a drawing a scene makes only some of the time moves the tear of all drawn after it, unless it
  is `sealed` or in `quiet`.
- A job's browser may be a window on the user's screen: a role or `SKILL.md` that sends a bot to
  the browser to look at what it made opens it in front of the user, where a skill's `shots` over
  `render.mjs --apart` shows it to the bot alone.
- The suites mock `pictures.ts`, stub `shots` and frame no page, so a contract between `skills/`
  and the app changed on one side breaks unseen: `render.mjs`'s options, the print mark
  and `features/reach/pictures.ts`; the last line of `deck.mjs shots` and
  `deck.tool.ts`; the shell's generator meta, `?face` and frame messages and `app/artifact`,
  `file-thumb.tsx`, `FileFrame`; `spreadsheet.mjs sync` (its exit 3) and `savePage`.
- A seed's text is copied into its bot when the bot is made, so a role change never reaches a bot
  already installed; what every bot must get lives in a skill or the base prompt.
- Two skills for one ask split the bots' choice; a new capability that extends an existing skill,
  or `make_deck`, does not.
- The call reads a `SKILL.md` description's first sentence alone (`skillLines` in
  `features/ai/prompts/prompt-helper.ts`): a description that does not say there what the skill
  does is not understood.

## Check
`pnpm test:skills` (`load_skill`'s file list, `put` against a reader's save, `make_deck`, motion
checks) and `pnpm test:artifact` (which finished file opens, viewer URLs). A kit script run by
hand from an empty folder outside the checkout and the workspace, with `THURSDAY_ARTIFACTS`
unset, writes under `./artifacts`: `node <repo>/skills/artifact/scripts/document.mjs put demo <repo>/skills/artifact/templates/document/memo.md`.
