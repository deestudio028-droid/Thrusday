# The call

The user talks to one Thursday — aloud, in writing, or from a phone chat — and she answers what
takes a glance on the spot and hands anything longer to a bot.

## Start here
- `features/thursday/use-thursday.ts` — a spoken call in the page: the Live session, relays, hanging up.
- `features/thursday/thursday.action.ts` — opens a call on the server and saves its rows.
- `lib/live/live.session.ts` — the GPT-Live wire: session events, appends, the backend's tool loop.
- `features/thursday/thursday.plan.ts` — a spoken call on the GPT Subscription, its backend run here.
- `lib/live/live.plan.ts` — the plan voice's socket: its hand-overs in, answers out.
- `features/thursday/thursday.text.ts` — a call in writing, for the page and for a phone.
- `features/ai/prompts/live.prompt.ts` — what the voice hears: persona, `## Always`, the delegation list.
- `features/ai/prompts/thursday.prompt.ts` — what the backend hears, on every way in.
- `features/thursday/open-work.ts` — background work as a call is told about it.
- `features/reach/reach.ts` — Thursday from a phone chat.
- `features/reach/email.ts` — a mailbox of hers as a phone channel: IMAP in, SMTP out, whose mail is vouched for.

## How it fits
A spoken call is two models on one Live connection: `openCallAction` builds the voice's prompt, the
backend's prompt and the tool manifest on the server, and the backend's tool calls arrive in the
page and run through `/api/thursday/tool-call`, but for the page's own (`callTools`), which
`use-thursday` runs. On the GPT Subscription (`liveLineOf`), whose voice has no backend,
`thursday.plan` runs hers and relays it to the page in the key's wire. A call in writing
(`use-text-call` → `/api/thursday/text`) and a phone (`reach.ts` → `answerInWriting`) are that
backend with no voice, run by `thursday.text`. Every way in reads the one `LiveSettings` row and is
kept as a call row that the next call's prompts read back; the browser's `thursday.store` holds only
how this machine reaches her. Background work reaches a call through `open-work` as it comes and
`call-standing`, what stood open as the call began, for the backend alone.

## What breaks
- Voice is GPT-Live, not the Realtime API: `/v1/live/sessions` on a key (`live.server.ts`), Codex's `/voice` call on the GPT Subscription (`live.plan.ts`). Code written from memory of Realtime matches neither wire.
- Her tool set is named in four places: `loadTools`, `loadThursdayPrompt`, and on a spoken call `CallHandshake.opened` and the tool-call route's schema, which drops a field it does not name. A switch that reaches only some tells her of a tool she lacks, or has the route build a set other than her manifest.
- The voice hands over only what her delegation list (`live.prompt`) names; a kind of request it leaves out she answers herself and never hands over.
- What reaches her that the user did not say — a bot's words, an act on screen, a press on a phone — steers her as if the app had said it when it goes in as `instructions`; as a fact, on a spoken call as `commentary` or `thinking`, it does not.
- A file put down is told to her only once it is in (`put-down.ts`): told first, she hands a question over before the backend has it.
- What is put down goes in after every output of its turn: one that ends without going on lets it go through `endResponse`, never `release`.
- The AI SDK answers a call it cannot take (a tool she lacks, a misfit input) itself; `thursday.plan` also handing it to the page gives one call id two results.
- An open call row keeps `isAnyCallLive` true, so `bot.runner` sends no desktop notice: a way into a call that does not end its row wherever the call ends silences them. A row the server holds rather than a tab is swept shut when the last tab goes unless `heldCalls` lists it.
- `take`'s check of the one person let in is all that stands between a phone channel and her: an `Incoming` kind that reaches her or a bot without it lets whoever sent it run commands on this computer through her.
- `take` checks `unproven` before anything else: a channel's `Incoming` that carries it and still reaches `hear` lets a mail forged in the named address's name run work through her; a `named` channel answers nobody but the named person.

## Check
`pnpm test:live` (the Live wire, what is put down, both call prompts, call history) and
`pnpm test:reach` (a phone, a call in writing, the settings row). To hear a call, place one on a
scratch server (AGENTS.md, Running the app); it needs a microphone and bills the key or the plan.
