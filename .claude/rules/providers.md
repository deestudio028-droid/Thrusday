# Models, keys and connectors

Bots use saved keys, ChatGPT sign-in or catalog keys. The user picks media models and connects
MCP servers.

## Start here
- `features/ai/model.schema.ts` — text and media providers, their shelves with context and effort steps.
- `features/ai/model.ts` — a model built from a ref and a key; the default and media picks; the catalogs (`readCatalog`).
- `features/ai/chatgpt.ts` — GPT Subscription: sign-in, renewal, plan usage, the Codex request shape, its pictures, a call on it.
- `lib/chatgpt-device.ts` — remote device-code sign-in requests and polling for a hosted instance.
- `features/ai/openrouter.ts` — OpenRouter's list read into the gateway's words, and its key's credit.
- `features/config/config.const.ts` — every key and app-wide model pick, grouped as Settings draws them.
- `features/connectors/mcp.manager.ts` — MCP sessions, their OAuth, reconnects.
- `features/ai/tools/connected.ts` — what answers `tool_search` and `tool_call`: MCP and the studio.
- `features/ai/tools/studio.tool.ts` — image, video, speech, transcription; each once a model is picked.
- `features/ai/components/model-picker.tsx` — the model field: providers, shelves, a catalog's browser.

## How it fits
Keys, the ChatGPT sign-in and the app-wide model picks are rows of the `config` table, read through
`readConfig`, where the environment wins (`/api/config` marks it `env`, and the actions refuse
to change it); the keys and the sign-in are sealed there
(`lib/secret.ts`), the picks are not. The provider records in `model.schema.ts` are the source: Settings'
key rows, the save's allow list, the picker's providers and the default-model fallback all derive
from them. Bots, a call in writing and a memory edit get their model from `model.ts`; a spoken call
opens through `lib/live` instead: on the OpenAI key with its backend there, or on the GPT
Subscription, whose backend `thursday.plan` gets from `model.ts`. Only a bot reaches connected
tools: its pinned ones as tools of their own, the rest through `tool_search` and `tool_call`
(`mcp.tool.ts`).

## What breaks
- A subscription sign-in other than ChatGPT's gets the user's own account closed: Claude's terms
  forbid using a Free, Pro or Max sign-in in any other product, and Google suspends accounts whose
  Gemini CLI sign-in a third-party app borrows.
- A default for a feature that costs per use (a picture, a film, speech, a transcript, a web
  search) spends a key added for one thing on a model nobody chose: such a feature runs on what the
  user picked for it or on the run's own model, and is otherwise absent. Only the model a bot or a
  call thinks with is chosen for the user (`resolveDefaultModel`, `runsOnOf` in `thursday.text.ts`,
  `liveLineOf` in `live.schema.ts`), and pictures on a paid GPT Subscription, which bills no key
  (`planMediaOf` in `model.schema.ts`).
- A text provider added to `model.schema.ts` alone saves fine, then fails on first use or quietly
  goes without search, `look_at` or its prompt cache: it also takes a case in `buildTextModel`
  (whose `default` refuses it at run time, not at compile time), its native search in
  `searchTools` where its SDK has one, a `seesToolImages` entry where its driver carries a picture
  inside a tool result, and a `promptCacheOptions` case where it caches only when asked. A media
  provider without its case in each `build…Model` for the kinds it lists goes without its studio
  tool.
- A key or token outside `CONFIG_GROUPS` (read with `readConfig`) cannot be set in Settings, and
  one named so `shellEnv` in `lib/sandbox.ts` does not strip it (`…_API_KEY`, `…_TOKEN`) reaches
  every command a bot runs once it is in `.env`.

## Check
`pnpm test:secrets` covers sealed keys and credentials; `pnpm test:bot` and `pnpm test:reach` fake `getTextModel`, and `pnpm test:live`
fakes `connected.ts`, so run them when those exports change. To see it, serve a
scratch copy (AGENTS.md › Running the app) and open Settings › API keys, Models and Connectors: a
model field browses a catalog provider's shelf without a key, and a preset that needs no account
connects.
