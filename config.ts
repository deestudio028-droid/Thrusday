 *   service holds the request open, so longer is fewer requests, not slower answers.

 * - `idleMs`  how long nothing is written before the conversation is closed as a call,
 *   unless work it started is still running. What is written next opens a new one, which
 *   reads this one back under Earlier calls. Shorter and an evening is many calls; longer and
 *   a finished thread raises no desktop notice meanwhile (an open call is taken to be listening).
 * - `messages`  how much of the conversation she is sent with a turn. Every turn sends all of
 *   it again, so this bounds what a long day of writing costs a turn, not what the model can
 *   hold. Only words are counted: what a tool answered and what she thought leave an older
 *   turn before this is looked at.
 * - `trimTo`  what is left once `messages` is passed, cut where the user speaks. Below it on
 *   purpose: a conversation that loses one message a turn opens differently every turn, and
 *   the provider's prompt cache never matches.
 * - `oldChars`  the most an older message keeps. The turn just answered is never cut.
 * - `files`  how many of the files her answer names are sent along with it. The rest are named
 *   in the chat as left on this computer.
 * - `fileBytes`  the largest file taken from a chat or sent to one, since each is held in
 *   memory whole. A service that takes less says so itself (its channel's `limits`); a file
 *   past either is named in the chat instead.
 * - `rateRetries`  how many times one request waits out a service's "too many requests"
 *   before its refusal stands. Higher rides out a longer burst; lower gives up on a long
 *   answer's last pieces sooner.
 * - `rateWaitMs`  the longest one such wait. A service asking for more is refused rather than
 *   waited on: a turn that waits holds up everything written after it.
 * - `codeDigits`  how long the code is that someone asking to be let in is sent, and the
 *   screen's Allow shows beside their name. Longer is harder to guess at a glance; shorter is
 *   quicker to compare.
 * - `held`  how many messages someone waiting to be let in may write before the rest are
 *   dropped; those kept are answered once they are let in. More keeps a longer first request;
 *   fewer bounds what a stranger can pile up in memory before being turned away.
 * - `pictures`  how many pictures of a page go with it (reach/pictures): its first slides or
 *   boards, or its first screens from the top. With the page's PDF that is ten files, what
 *   one Discord message carries and one Telegram album holds; the PDF has the rest.
 * - `drawMs`  how long drawing them may take before the page goes without them. Nine slides
 *   draw in a few seconds; a page that never finishes loading would otherwise hold up
 *   everything sent after it.
 * - `lookMs`  how long a change to the threads waits before open work is looked for, so the
 *   changes after it in the same burst are one look: a working bot changes threads many times
 *   a second. Longer holds a bot's question or ending that much longer before the phone gets
 *   it; shorter reads the inbox more often while bots work.
 * - `mailFreshMs`  how old a mail may be and still be read (reach/email), by when it was
 *   written and when it arrived. It bounds the backlog answered after the app was off, and
 *   an old mail of theirs, still carrying their mail service's signature, being sent to her
 *   again by someone it once went to. Longer answers mail from further back; shorter turns
 *   away one that was slow on its way.
 * - `mailCheckAgainMs`  how long a mail waits to be checked again when its sender's records
 *   could not be looked up (no network, a resolver down). Only mail from the one who may write
 *   is checked at all, so it is not passed over: the mailbox waits on it and the screen says
 *   why. Shorter answers sooner once the network is back; longer asks DNS less while it is down.
 * - `mailHoldMs`  how long such a mail is held before it is refused, with that as the reason
 *   they are told. Everything they write waits behind it meanwhile. Longer rides out a longer
 *   DNS outage; shorter tells them sooner that a domain whose records never answer is the
 *   trouble, and lets their next mail through.
 * - `mailPushAfterMs`  how long the mailbox's connection is quiet before the server is asked
 *   to say when mail arrives (IMAP IDLE). A mail that arrives before then waits for it: the
 *   library's own 15 seconds made every answer to a quick reply that much later. Lower asks
 *   sooner, at two extra round trips when a command follows within it.
 * - `mailIdleMs`  how long the mailbox's connection idles before it is renewed. A server may
 *   drop an idle one after 30 minutes (RFC 3501 §5.4), and some drop it sooner without a word;
 *   longer risks a connection that is gone before anyone knows, shorter renews it for nothing.
 * - `mailDnsMs`  how long a sender's DNS records may take to look up before the mail is set
 *   aside to be checked again (`mailCheckAgainMs`). Longer waits out a slow resolver; shorter lets
 *   one slow domain hold up the inbox for less time.
 * - `mailIdsKept`  how many Message-IDs of mail already answered are kept, so one sent to her
 *   again is not answered again. More remembers further back, in the one config row.
 * - `mailLookMs`  how often the mailbox is looked through even when the mail server has not
 *   said anything arrived. A server's word that mail arrived can be lost with a connection
 *   that drops quietly; shorter finds such a mail sooner, longer asks the server less.
