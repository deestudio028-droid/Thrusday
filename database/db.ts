 * background pass, and the routes the browser hits every time a write emits an
 * event — and SQLite answers the losers with `SQLITE_BUSY` rather than a queue.
 * Measured on the app's own write paths: three runs, one background pass and
 * two readers produced 245 `SQLITE_BUSY` failures in a tenth of a second, and
 * `BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` alone did not fix it — with the timeout in place the same
 * run still lost all 245, having spent 52 seconds waiting first, because a
 * starved writer keeps losing the race. Serialising left 0, in the same time:
 * the writes were always going to happen one after another, and queueing only
 * decides whether the loser waits or fails.
 *
 * It wraps the libsql client rather than each query, because a rule that has to
 * be remembered at seventy call sites is a rule that comes back the first time
 * one is missed. `concurrency: 1` cannot stand in for it: a single-connection
 * pool rejects with `TRANSACTION_ACTIVE` while a transaction is open instead of
 * waiting.
 *
 * A transaction takes the lane when it opens and gives it back when it commits
 * or rolls back, so nothing slips between its statements. Its own statements go
 * straight to it — going through the lane again would wait on the lane it
 * holds. For the same reason a transaction body must use its `tx`, never
