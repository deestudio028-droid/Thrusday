# Product Brief

You help users create and maintain a product brief. This captures foundational positioning and messaging information that other marketing jobs reference, so users don't repeat themselves.

The brief is one file of your memory, `memory/product-<product>.md` in your own folder, one per product: the same person may market more than one thing. Its first line is what a memory listing shows while the user keeps bot memory on, so a later job sees it is there without looking; Step 1 looks in the folder either way. Like any memory file it stays within the memory's size limit.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check for an Existing Brief

First, check whether your memory (`memory/` in your own folder) already holds a brief for this product.

**If it exists:**
- Read it and summarize what's captured — note its current **Document version** and the last few **Changelog** entries so the user sees where the brief stands and what's changed recently
- Ask which sections they want to update
- Only gather info for those sections
- On any substantive save, bump the version and add a changelog entry (see Step 4). This brief is what every other marketing job starts from, so a dated paper trail of *what changed and why* is worth keeping.

**If it doesn't exist, offer two options:**

1. **Auto-draft from what exists** (recommended): You'll study what is already public (their website, landing and store pages, profiles, a README, anything they point you to) and draft a V1 of the brief. The user then reviews, corrects, and fills gaps. This is faster than starting from scratch.

2. **Start from scratch**: when nothing about the product is public, gather the sections in one round of questions.

Most users prefer option 1. Present the draft with one question beside it: "What needs correcting? What's missing?"

### Step 2: Gather Information

**If auto-drafting:**
1. Read what exists: their site, landing and about pages, marketing copy, meta descriptions, any docs they point you to
2. Draft all sections based on what you find
3. Present the draft and ask, in one question, what needs correcting or is missing
4. Fold their answer in and save; another round only if they ask for one

**If starting from scratch:**
Gather what the pages already say, then ask what only the user knows in one question with the sections below as its parts. A question stops your work until they answer, so one question holds all of it.

For each section:
1. Fill it from what you read, and name where you read it
2. Mark what no page answers
3. Make what is left a part of that one question
4. Move to the next

Push for verbatim customer language — exact phrases are more valuable than polished descriptions because they reflect how customers actually think and speak, which makes copy more resonant.

## Sections to Capture

### 1. Product Overview
- One-line description
- What it does (2-3 sentences)
- Product category (what "shelf" you sit on—how customers search for you)
- Product type (SaaS, marketplace, e-commerce, service, etc.)
- Business model and pricing

### 2. Target Audience
- Target company type (industry, size, stage)
- Target decision-makers (roles, departments)
- Primary use case (the main problem you solve)
- Jobs to be done (2-3 things customers "hire" you for)
- Specific use cases or scenarios

### 3. Personas (B2B only)
If multiple stakeholders are involved in buying, capture for each:
- User, Champion, Decision Maker, Financial Buyer, Technical Influencer
- What each cares about, their challenge, and the value you promise them

### 4. Problems & Pain Points
- Core challenge customers face before finding you
- Why current solutions fall short
- What it costs them (time, money, opportunities)
- Emotional tension (stress, fear, doubt)

### 5. Competitive Landscape
- **Direct competitors**: Same solution, same problem (e.g., Calendly vs SavvyCal)
- **Secondary competitors**: Different solution, same problem (e.g., Calendly vs Superhuman scheduling)
- **Indirect competitors**: Conflicting approach (e.g., Calendly vs personal assistant)
- How each falls short for customers

### 6. Differentiation
- Key differentiators (capabilities alternatives lack)
- How you solve it differently
- Why that's better (benefits)
- Why customers choose you over alternatives

### 7. Objections & Anti-Personas
- Top 3 objections heard in sales and how to address them
- Who is NOT a good fit (anti-persona)

### 8. Switching Dynamics
The JTBD Four Forces:
- **Push**: What frustrations drive them away from current solution
- **Pull**: What attracts them to you
- **Habit**: What keeps them stuck with current approach
- **Anxiety**: What worries them about switching

### 9. Customer Language
- How customers describe the problem (verbatim)
- How they describe your solution (verbatim)
- Words/phrases to use
- Words/phrases to avoid
- Glossary of product-specific terms

### 10. Brand Voice
- Tone (professional, casual, playful, etc.)
- Communication style (direct, conversational, technical)
- Brand personality (3-5 adjectives)

### 11. Proof Points
- Key metrics or results to cite
- Notable customers/logos
- Testimonial snippets
- Main value themes and supporting evidence

### 12. Goals
- Primary business goal
- Key conversion action (what you want people to do)
- Current metrics (if known)

## Step 3: Create the Brief

After gathering information, create `memory/product-<product>.md` in your own folder with this structure:

```markdown
# [Product] — product brief: [one-line description]

**Document version:** v1
**Last updated:** [date]

## Product Overview
**One-liner:**
**What it does:**
**Product category:**
**Product type:**
**Business model:**

## Changelog
*Newest first. One line per revision: what changed and why.*
- v1 ([date]) — Initial brief.
```

---

## Step 4: Confirm, Version, and Save

- Show the completed brief
- Ask if anything needs adjustment
- **Set the version and changelog** — this is the paper trail for a brief every other marketing job reads:
  - **New brief:** set `Document version: v1` and a single Changelog entry — `- v1 ([today]) — Initial brief.`
  - **Updating an existing brief:** increment the version (v2 → v3 …), update `Last updated` to today, and **prepend a new Changelog entry** at the top of the list (newest first) summarizing *what changed and why* in one line. Never rewrite or reorder past entries.
  - A good entry names the sections touched and the reason, not "updated the brief." Examples:
    - `- v3 (2026-07-16) — Repositioned from "email tool" to "deliverability platform"; added RevOps to the ICP.`
    - `- v2 (2026-06-02) — Rewrote value prop and objections after 5 customer interviews; added competitor Acme.`
  - Use today's date in ISO form (YYYY-MM-DD) for the entry and `Last updated`.
  - **Pure typo-only fix:** don't bump the version or add a changelog entry — just save the correction. Every other change bumps the version and gets an entry. When the change is a real repositioning, say so plainly — downstream jobs will now generate against the new brief.
- Save to `memory/product-<product>.md` in your own folder
- Tell them the rest of the marketing work starts from this brief, and that the Changelog at the bottom tracks how the positioning evolves.

## Tips

- **Be specific**: Ask "What's the #1 frustration that brings them to you?" not "What problem do they solve?"
- **Capture exact words**: Customer language beats polished descriptions
- **Ask for examples**: "Can you give me an example?" unlocks better answers
- **Validate in one pass**: put your reading of every section in the one question, not a round per section
- **Skip what doesn't apply**: Not every product needs all sections (e.g., Personas for B2C)
