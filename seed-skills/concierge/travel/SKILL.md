# Travel

Three scripts: the page is this skill's, and the weather and the money are `data-report`'s, which
every bot has. No key, a few lines of output; chain the ones a step needs with `&&` in one bash
call. `S=<this skill's dir>/scripts`, `D=$THURSDAY_SKILLS/data-report/scripts`.

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `node $D/weather.mjs "<place>[, <CC>]" <from> [<to>] [--f]` | The forecast a line a day, or past the 16 days it reaches, what the same days were like the last five years. `--f` prints °F |
| `node $D/fx.mjs <amount> <FROM> <TO[,TO…]>` | The amount at today's rate, with the rate's date and where it came from |
| `node $S/itinerary.mjs <trip.json> [--name <file>]` | The trip as one page in your `artifacts/` folder: a gallery of each place, what to do and watch for there, the money and what is left to book in view, the way, the days, costs added up. Uses the browser only for a `"photo"` page url |
| `node $THURSDAY_SKILLS/artifact/scripts/document.mjs pdf <page path>` | The page as a PDF beside it, when they ask for one; a page sent to their phone goes with its PDF already |

**The search is yours.** Flights, stays and their prices are this skill's work, not a question to
hand to another bot: a hand-off pays for a second bot's prompt, skills and browser, and for the
messages between you, to find what one search of yours finds.

**Flights come from a published search; the rest from a page on the user's screen.** You read
only what that page shows them, never a site's own endpoints behind it: a search page moves
without notice, and a wrong price is worse than none.

- **With Kiwi connected** — `search-flight` on the `kiwi` server, among your own tools or under
  `## Connected tools` in your prompt — flights are that tool (`tool_search` it for the exact
  inputs): places or airport codes, dates and the party in, and for each flight its price, both
  legs' times and stops, and its booking link.
- **Without it, and for a stay**, the results are the user's to choose from, so the search opens
  on their screen — `--headed`, the `browser` skill — and you read it there. The answer then ends
  by saying that connecting Kiwi in Settings › Connectors finds flights without a window. Google's
  public search pages take the search in their address, as it reads today:

```
https://www.google.com/travel/flights?q=Flights to LIS from LHR on 2026-11-12 through 2026-11-15 for 2 adults&curr=USD&hl=en
https://www.google.com/travel/search?q=hotels in Alfama, Lisbon&hl=en
```

Percent-encode the `q` before passing it to a command. What those pages carry, and what they do not:

- **The flights `q` is a sentence:**
  `Flights to <TO> from <FROM> on <depart>[ through <return>][ for N adults[ and M children]]`,
  with airport codes or city names. Anything more — nonstop, the cabin, one way — is set on the
  page. A `q` it did not follow opens the Flights front page, so check the page names your route
  and your dates before you read a price off it.
- **Google Hotels prices are in the machine's currency**, whatever `curr=` or `gl=` says — its
  footer names the address it read that from — and the number on a result row is one night.
  Convert with `fx.mjs` before comparing against a budget, and name the currency you read.
  Google Flights does honour `curr=`.
- **A stay's dates and guests are set on the page.** Google Hotels opens on dates and a party of
  its own, whatever the address says: set the check-in, the check-out and the guests there, and
  read no price until the page shows them.
- **A price is what the page showed at that moment.** Give it with the day you read it, in your
  answer and on the page, and never from memory. It is a quote until it is booked.

Where the rest is written down:

- A whole trip, from the question to the page: `references/plan.md`
- Handing a booking over: `references/book.md`
- The page's JSON, field by field: `references/itinerary.md`
