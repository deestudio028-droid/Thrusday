# When something does not work

Say what happened and the one thing that fixes it; most problems are a setting or a key.

## A call will not open, or ended

- **"Could not start the call on your GPT Subscription"** (or **on your OpenAI key**), or **"The
  call on … failed"**, names what the call ran on and shows the provider's words as they came:
  they say what went wrong, such as a spent plan or a refused key (**Settings › API keys**). A model the key cannot use is changed in **Settings ›
  Thursday**, under Models, and **runs on** there moves calls to the other line.
- **A call on the GPT Subscription is refused**: the reason is the plan's own, such as its usage
  spent. **runs on** in **Settings › Thursday › Models** moves calls to the OpenAI key, and asks for
  one there when none is set.
- **"… refused its line (1006). What she reads of you comes to about … tokens"**: what she keeps
  about them in **Profile** and **Preferences**, which a call reads whole, has grown past what a
  call can carry. Tidy those two notes in **Settings › Memory** (merge, or forget what is no longer
  true), then call again.
- **Signed in on the Free plan**: ChatGPT has no spoken calls on it. Add an OpenAI key, or sign in
  again with a paid plan; bots and calls in writing work on Free as they are.
- **"One call at a time"**: another tab of the app has a spoken call on. Hang up there first.
- **She cannot be heard** on a call she opened herself: the browser holds sound until the page is
  touched. A tap anywhere fixes it.
- **She does not hear them**: the microphone was refused, or another app is using it. Allow it again
  from the site's settings in the address bar.
- **The call ended by itself**: the line under her face says why, such as *25s of quiet* (nothing
  said for 25 seconds), *Thursday hung up* or *the connection dropped*.

## "Hey thursday" does nothing

The wake phrase comes on when the microphone is turned on in the first run; skipped there, it is
off until it is switched on in **Settings › Thursday › Starting a call**, where the phrase can also
be changed. It needs a browser with speech recognition, the microphone, and the
app's tab open. When it cannot start, the screen says "Wake word off" with the reason; once that
is fixed, switching it off and on there tries again. Tapping her face always works.

## A job stopped

A job does not fail for good; it pauses and waits.

- **It asked something**: the question is in its thread, in the corner at the bottom right.
  Answering it, on screen or through her, carries it on.
- **The model failed or the provider refused**: the thread says why. Fix the key or pick another
  model on the bot's page, then press **Continue**.
- **The GPT Subscription ran out**: the job says when the plan resets; its row in **Settings › API
  keys** shows *Limit reached*. A call in writing, on screen or from a phone, goes on on the OpenAI
  key when one is set (`calls.md`); a job does not.
- **The app stopped while it ran** (terminal closed, computer restarted), or **it reached its step
  limit**: **Continue** picks it up. Closing the browser tab does not stop jobs.
- **They stopped it**: writing to the thread starts it again.

## A bot says it cannot do something

- **Make an image, a video, speech, or a transcript**: pick a model for it in **Settings › Models**,
  under Studio. An image needs none while the GPT Subscription is signed in on a paid plan.
- **Open a web page**: the bots' browser downloads in the background on first start, a few hundred
  megabytes. On a Linux server it may also need `npx playwright install-deps chromium`, run once
  with administrator rights.
- **Use this Mac's apps**: macOS must allow Screen Recording and Accessibility in System Settings.
- **Sign in or pay**: on purpose. The bot opens the page and waits; paying is always theirs to
  press. A site that asks for a sign-in on every job can be used through their own Chrome
  (`setup.md`, Sites they signed in to).
- **Search the web**: a bot on the Vercel AI Gateway or a provider without its own search opens
  pages instead. A search key (Exa) in **Settings › API keys** gives every bot search.
- **Reach a connected service**: one that needs signing in again turns red in **Settings ›
  Connectors**; **Reconnect** fixes it.
- **Take a file**: at most 8 files go with one message, 25 MB each.

## A saved key is asked for again

The keys, tokens, sign-in and connectors saved in Settings are sealed with a key kept in the data
folder's `.env` (`setup.md`, Where the files are), and nowhere else. When that `.env` is lost or
replaced, or the database moved without it, the next start makes a new key, and what can no longer
be opened is marked where it is set: **Enter again** on its row in **Settings › API keys**, with a
dot on the section, and in the model picker; **Stopped** on its service in **Settings › Phone**,
where whoever was let in stays; a line on the connector in **Settings › Connectors**. The terminal
names them too.

Nothing is deleted. The `.env` from a backup, put back and the app started again, opens them, as
long as nothing was entered anew in between. Otherwise paste each one again, or remove the ones
no longer wanted. A connector that took a key is added again under the same name with its key, and
its bots keep their tools; one that signs in waits until **Reconnect**, which asks for the sign-in
again — a bot or a routine using it meanwhile is told so, and the old sign-in stays until then.

## A key cannot be removed or replaced

A key or token set in the environment the app started with — a `.env` next to the app, or one
exported in the shell — is used over one saved in Settings. Its row in **Settings › API keys** or
its step in **Settings › Phone** says it is set in the environment, and offers no Remove or
Replace, since neither would change the key in use. Change or remove it where it is set, then start the app again.

## Starting over

**Settings › Thursday › History › Reset history** deletes every call, every job and everything she
remembers, for good; keys, bots and connectors stay, and so does what each bot keeps for itself.
Wiping everything, keys included, means deleting the data folder (`setup.md`, Where the files are).

## Still stuck

**Ask on Discord**, under community in the Settings list, opens the app's community. A bug that
happens again the same way goes to **GitHub**, just below it, as an issue with the steps that bring
it back.
