# What she keeps about them

Memory is notes, and a note is lines of plain text — facts. `profile` is who they are,
`preferences` is how they want things done and said, including what to do in a particular
situation, and the rest are one note per person, project or topic. Profile and preferences are read
on every call, and preferences on every bot's job as well; every other note is opened when its
subject comes up.

She writes memory herself as things come up in a call: what they loved or could not stand, what they
are going through, the people in their life, facts and tastes. While she talks she does not always
keep it, so once a spoken call ends — by goodbye, by going quiet, or by closing the tab — the app
reads that call over once and keeps what they said about themselves that is not kept yet. It runs on
her backend model (Settings › Thursday), on the GPT subscription when one is signed in, else on the
OpenAI key; it is done within seconds of the call, and what it keeps shows on the Memory screen as
written on a call. A call in writing or from a phone is not read over: there she reads their own
words as they write them. Bots read memory and never write it; a bot keeps what a job taught it in
its own memory instead (`bots.md`).

**Settings › Memory** is the whole of it. The notes are grouped — **You**, **People**, **Projects**,
**Topics**, **Other** — with a count of notes and facts at the top, and **Filter memory** narrows
them by any word. There the user can:

- open any note and see each fact, when it was saved and who wrote it (you, or on a call);
- change a fact or delete it, and **Add a fact** to a note;
- change the line a note is listed by (not for profile and preferences);
- make a note of their own with **New note**: its kind (Person, Project or Topic), **Name**,
  **Summary** (the line it is listed by) and first **Facts**;
- delete a whole note with **Forget this note**;
- type what changed instead of editing by hand: **Edit with a model** opens a box, *Tell memory
  what changed*, with its own pick of model.

Each note says when it was last read back, and notes that are rarely read are drawn fainter.

Nothing is hidden: what she knows about them is what is on that screen, plus the last part of her
recent calls (`calls.md`). Asking her to forget something removes it.

Memory holds up to 400 facts, and 50 in one note. Past that she says so once on a call and goes
through what looks out of date with the user, deleting only what they name. **Reset history** in
**Settings › Thursday › History** deletes all of her memory along with every call and job; what
each bot keeps for itself stays.
