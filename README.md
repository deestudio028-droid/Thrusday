**An open-source voice assistant on GPT-Live 1, with a team of AI bots behind it.**<br>
Runs on your computer, on your ChatGPT plan or your own OpenAI key. You talk; bots take the slow work to a real browser, a shell and your files.

## Quick start

```bash
npx thursday-agent
```

Needs Node.js 22.18+ and a paid ChatGPT plan's sign-in or one OpenAI API key, given on the first screen. Pick your starter bots and **tap her face**. No new account, no `.env`. On your plan a call spends its usage, not money; on a key the voice costs about $0.05 a minute.

## Try saying

- “Find me a coat under two hundred dollars and put the options on one page.”
- “Every weekday at nine, go through my mail and draft the replies.”
- “Remember my sister's birthday is March third.”
- “Where is that coat job?”, while it is still running.

### Talk while it works

A speech model that opens a browser goes silent for a minute, and a silent call is a dead call. So anything slower than a few seconds goes to a bot, and she keeps talking — interrupt her, change the subject, or ask how the job is going.

### One ask, a whole team

The bot you hand a job to brings in the others, can hold a part until the result it needs is in, checks what comes back, and asks you only when a decision is yours. Every handoff is saved: open the thread to see who did what, or step in.

### Watch it as an office

Open a job and it is drawn as an office: each bot at its desk, the work walked from desk to desk, a hand-off that waits for another bot's answer held in its tray with a dashed line to the bot it waits on, and the report brought to your counter. When the report lands, every bot leaps and throws its papers in the air.

### Errands, in a real browser

Orders, bookings, forms, the inbox. A bot uses its own browser or the Chrome you are already signed into. A purchase stops at the Pay button, left open on your screen for you to press.

### Results you can keep

Pages, charts, videos, slides, docs and scripts, saved as files on your machine. A finished one shows up in the corner of your screen, and “show me” opens it.

## How it works

Thursday is an open-source voice assistant that runs on your own computer. OpenAI's GPT-Live 1 holds the call, on your ChatGPT plan in the voice the Codex CLI uses or on an OpenAI key, and a Responses model runs its tools. Anything slower than a few seconds goes to a background bot: a text model from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google or xAI, with a shell, a real browser, your files, Agent Skills and MCP servers. Bots hand parts of a job to each other and ask you when a decision is yours; their results and questions come back into the live call, and jobs keep running after you hang up. Routines start jobs on a schedule. What she knows about you is plain notes you can read. You can write to her instead of talking, from the app, from Telegram, Discord or Slack, or by email.

## Before you run it

- **The models are not local.** The app, your data and your keys stay on your machine. Call audio goes to OpenAI, and bots run on the providers you add. Local endpoints for bots are [an open issue](https://github.com/cgoinglove/thursday-agent/issues/16).
- **It is not a sandbox.** Bots run real commands as you. Stopping at Pay and asking before using a login are instructions a model follows, not locks. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before giving it access to anything sensitive.
- **Built on macOS.** Linux should work; Windows is not tested yet. Screens are in English; she speaks your language.

<details>
<summary><b>What does it cost?</b></summary>

Thursday is free and MIT-licensed. You bring the account: a signed-in ChatGPT plan runs calls, bots and, on a paid plan, pictures on its own usage, and on an OpenAI key the voice bills about $0.05 a minute while a call is open, silence included ([pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing)). Bots bill per token on whichever provider you pick for them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where does my data go?</b></summary>

What you say on a call and what bots work on go to the model providers you set up and the services you connect. The “hey thursday” wake phrase comes on when you turn the microphone on in the first run, and is otherwise off until you switch it on: it uses your browser's speech recognition, which in Chrome sends microphone audio to Google while the tab is open. A tap on her face starts a call without it. When you let the browser share your location, the page sends it to BigDataCloud and Open-Meteo for your town's name and its weather, and her prompt gets those two; say no and nothing is sent. The app listens on `127.0.0.1`, and your calls, memory and files live in `~/.thursday` (or the checkout, when you run from source).
