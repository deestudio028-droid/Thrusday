/**
 * A script's way into this shell's own browser session (PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION): every
 * call is one `playwright-cli --raw run-code`, and what the code returns comes back parsed.
 *
 * The code runs in a bare VM beside the browser, not in Node and not in the page: no
 * `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `fetch`, `setTimeout` or `require`. Build addresses with
 * string work and `encodeURIComponent`, fetch with `page.request` (it carries the
 * session's cookies), wait with `page.waitForTimeout` / `page.waitForFunction`, and do
 * DOM work inside `page.evaluate`. Files are written by the caller from what returns.
 *
 * A skill's own script reaches it through the shipped skills folder, which a bot's shell
 * names in THURSDAY_SKILLS:
 *
 *   const { inPage } = await import(`${process.env.THURSDAY_SKILLS}/browser/scripts/session.mjs`);
