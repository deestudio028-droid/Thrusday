# The brief

One page the user reads in a few minutes over coffee, trusts, and could get nowhere else: it
is theirs. A lead story and a few more in full, each with its photo, two lines, what changed
since an earlier brief told it and why it is this reader's; the stories they follow as a line
through the days; the rest as headlines; today's weather as what to do about it; and the brief
to hear. One bash call to gather, one to read the chosen stories, one for each file
of their words, one to lay out. Nothing in between.

## Gather

One `news.mjs` call holds every topic, and `glance.mjs` rides in the same bash call.

- A topic's query is what Google News would be searched with: `OR` between names, quotes for
  a phrase, `-word` to leave something out, `site:` for one outlet. Keep the label short —
  it heads the topic's section on the page.
- The edition is the language the user reads news in: `--lang en --country US` searches
  American outlets in English, `--lang de --country DE` German ones in German. A topic about
  another country is still searched in the reader's edition, by its name in that language.
- `--hours` is the freshness window: 30 for a daily brief, so yesterday morning's story is
  still in; 72 after a weekend. Publisher feeds come in with `--feed "<label>=<rss url>"`.
- The glance takes FRED series ids and currency pairs, each the last close against the one before:
  `SP500`, `NASDAQCOM`, `DJIA`, `NIKKEI225`, `CBBTCUSD` Bitcoin, `DGS10` the 10-year Treasury,
  `DCOILWTICO` oil, and `EUR/USD` for a pair of the ECB's currencies. `Label:id` names one; the
  weather wants a city's name. An index FRED does not carry, or one company's shares, is not in the
  glance: a story that turns on it gives the number, from the article.

## Choose

Read the printed list and pick the stories yourself, then pass their ids to `story.mjs` in the
order the page will show them, lead first. Every topic the user chose gets at least one story.

- **One story, one line.** Several candidates on the same news with different headlines (the
  script folds only copies under one title): keep the one with the most outlets (`+6`) or
  from a preferred source (`[preferred]`).
- **News, not noise.** Leave out listicles, stock-pick columns, opinion, press releases
  dressed as news, "how to" pieces and anything the user said they are tired of. A number of
  outlets is a signal of weight; a single small site is worth a place only when it has
  something nobody else does.
- **The lead** is the story that matters most to this user today — not the loudest one — and
  it should have a photo.
- **Size** comes from their preferences; without one, a lead, three in full and two or three short.
- Pass a spare for each topic too: a publisher that refuses leaves a gap, and the spare
  fills it without another call.

## Read what they say

`story.mjs` prints a line a story — which publisher it came from, whether it has a photo,
and which `text-<n>.md` file holds its words — and writes the words themselves into those
files, each one whole read. Run one `cat` a file, in the order it printed them, and nothing
else in that call. A story it marked `NO TEXT` is in no file: take one of your spares.

## Write brief.json

Write it after reading those files — the article's own words are the only source for a
summary. Never state a fact they do not hold.

```json
{
  "title": "Morning Brief",
  "lede": "One sentence on what today is about.",
  "lang": "en",
  "stories": "stories/stories.json",
  "glance": "glance.json",
  "day": "Rain from mid-afternoon: take an umbrella.",
  "lead": { "id": "a1", "kicker": "AI", "headline": "…", "summary": "…", "why": "…",
            "since": "…", "yours": "…" },
  "items": [
    { "id": "b2", "headline": "…", "summary": "…", "why": "…" },
    { "id": "c4", "headline": "…", "short": true }
  ],
  "following": [
    { "topic": "Starship", "steps": [{ "date": "Sep 12", "text": "…" }, { "date": "Today", "text": "…" }] }
  ],
  "spoken": "The 60-second version, as it will be read aloud.",
  "audio": null,
  "labels": {}
}
```

`title` is the paper's name — the page prints the date above it. A path is relative to
`brief.json` or to the workspace, so a path a tool handed you (`artifacts/<bot>/….mp3`)
goes in exactly as it came. Leave out `glance` when there is none. `items` group into
sections by the topic they were found under, in your order; `"section": "…"` on an item moves
it to another. `lang` sets dates and numbers; for a page that is not in English, `labels`
gives the page's own words in that language: `title`, `why` ("Why it matters"), `listen`
("The 60-second version"), `hear` ("Listen", on the button that plays the audio), `photo`,
`made` (keep `{time}` and `{count}` in it), `count` (keep `{n}`: "{n} stories"), `today`,
`yours` ("For you"), `following`, `more` ("More headlines").

- **headline** — the news in plain words, under about 70 characters. Rewrite the publisher's
  when it is a tease ("You won't believe…", a question, "Here's why"). The subject does
  something: "Samsung cuts memory output by 10%", not "Samsung's memory move".
- **summary** — two sentences at most, under 280 characters, that a person could repeat at
  lunch: what happened, with the one number or name that makes it concrete, then the most
  important detail. No adjectives the article did not earn, no "could", "may" or "sparks"
  unless the article says it is uncertain.
- **why** — one sentence on what it changes for this reader and their interests; leave it
  empty rather than write a platitude ("This could have big implications").
- **lede** — the day in one sentence, naming two or three of the stories.
- **since** — for a story an earlier brief told (the headlines `news.mjs` prints under the list,
  with their dates): one sentence, what that brief said and what is new today. Only from those
  headlines; never for a story told for the first time.
- **yours** — one sentence on why this story is this reader's: what they asked about, a topic or
  a name they keep (their preferences, your memory of them). Only a link you can point to;
  leave it out otherwise — a made-up "you'll love this" is worse than none.
- **following** — a story this reader is following across days: its `topic`, and `steps`, two to
  five moments oldest first, each a `date` and a line from the briefs that told them, today's
  last. Only from those printed headlines.
- **short** — `true` on an item that is worth a headline and no more: it goes under "More
  headlines" as one line, with no summary. Keep the full ones to the lead and two to four
  more; the rest are short. A reader finishes a brief that is short.
- **day** — the weather as what to do about it, from the glance's forecast: "Rain from 3 pm:
  take an umbrella", "Hot by noon: water". Leave it out when there is nothing to do.
- **spoken** — the whole brief as it sounds, about 150 words for 60 seconds: a greeting, the
  lead in two sentences, then one sentence a story, the glance in one line when there is one,
  and a close. Written to be heard: short sentences, no parentheses, no urls, numbers as
  they are said.

## Audio, before the page is laid out

Only when the user's preferences ask for it: `generate_speech` through `tool_call` on the
studio server with `spoken` as the text, the same voice every day, then the path it answers
with as `audio` in `brief.json`, copied exactly — the page carries the player. Do this
before laying out, so the page is written once. No speech model (the tool is not found or
answers that it cannot make audio) means no audio today: say so in one line and hand back
the page.

## Lay it out, look once

`page.mjs` writes `brief-<date>.html` into your folder under `artifacts/`, one file with the
photos inside it, and says what it is missing. It refuses a summary that runs long or an id
it does not know; fix `brief.json` and run it again. With `--look` it also renders the top of
the page at phone width and prints the PNG's path.

`look_at` that PNG once, and only once — the photos are what can be wrong (a logo, a stock
picture of another thing, the wrong person). A wrong photo: set `"image": null` on that
story in `brief.json`, or swap the story, and lay it out again without `--look`.

## Hand back

Your final text holds the page's path, then the spoken version exactly as written, so
Thursday can read it aloud, then one line on anything left out (a refused publisher, no
glance).
