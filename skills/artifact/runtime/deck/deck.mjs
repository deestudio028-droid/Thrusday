// A deck: slides of one exact size in one HTML file that opens offline. The file holds the
// deck as data — its title, its theme and its slides, as JSON between the put marks — and
// draws the slides from it itself (deck.js). The app's deck tool (features/ai/tools/deck.tool)
// checks the deck and runs this; it answers in one line of JSON on stdout.
//
//   node deck.mjs put <file> <deck.json> [--revision <r>]
//       The deck into <file>, in the frame as it ships now: { "revision" }. A file that
//       names another revision than <r> — changed in the app, or written by a job that did
//       not see it — is left alone, exit 3: { "changed", "revision", "deck" }; so is a page
//       that holds no deck, its deck null.
//   node deck.mjs shots <file>
//       Every slide as slide-01.png… beside it: { "pictures", "cut" }, `cut` naming the
//       slides that came out taller or wider than a slide, which is what does not fit.
