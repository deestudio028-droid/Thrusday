# Company snapshot

How a company is doing, or how its latest results went, in the terms investors and employees use.

## Collect

- The latest quarter and the same quarter a year earlier: revenue, operating income, net income,
  margin; the full-year figures for context. From the company's own filing or results release —
  a US filer through `fetch.mjs sec`, one listed elsewhere from its regulator's filing system or
  its IR page.
- What management said it expects next (guidance), in their words, with the date.
- Consensus estimates, only from a page that shows them, with that page's name and date; the
  beat or miss is actual against that.
- The share price reaction: the close before the release against the close after, from the
  exchange's page or a quote site's historical prices (`sources.md`), and against the market index
  over the same days (`fetch.mjs fred` for one FRED carries).
- Valuation when asked: price ÷ earnings per share over the last four quarters, with both inputs.

## Final text

The headline in one sentence (grew or shrank, by how much, beat or missed), the one number
behind the reaction, and what to watch next quarter.

## Page

1. Title: the result as a finding. Lede: the headline and its cause.
2. A results table: this quarter, a year ago, change; estimates beside it when you have them.
3. Revenue and operating income by quarter, two years (`--quarterly`), as a line or bars.
4. The price around the release against the index (`--index`), marked at the release.
5. Three things to watch, each with the level that would matter.
