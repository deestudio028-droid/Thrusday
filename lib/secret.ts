/**
 * The secrets the app keeps in its database — API keys, the phone's bot tokens, the ChatGPT
 * sign-in, a connector's headers and OAuth tokens — are sealed with one key before they are
 * written, so a copy of `local.db` on its own (a backup, a synced folder, a file attached to an
 * issue, a table a command dumped) carries none of them.
 *
 * The key is the data folder's own: its `.env`, and nothing else. Not the environment: a
 * checkout's `.env`, which Next loads into the environment of every start from that checkout,
 * would be taken for the key of another data folder started from it (`--home`, THURSDAY_HOME),
 * and a start that does not carry the variable — the background job's, whose launchd entry sets
 * three variables of its own (bin/background.mjs) — would make a key of its own beside the one
 * the database was sealed with.
 *
 * What it does not do is keep them from anything that runs as the user: a bot's shell runs as
 * the user and can read the `.env` (SECURITY.md). The key never reaches its environment —
 * `lib/sandbox` strips every THURSDAY_ variable and every name with KEY in it.
