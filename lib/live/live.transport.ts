 * plays the answer as a track and handles barge-in itself, so nothing here
 * decodes, plays or truncates audio.
 *
 * A call on the GPT subscription's line answers with a relay as well
 * (thursday.plan): its events then come from the server, which runs her backend
 * for that voice, and go back to it, while the media stays here. The data
 * channel is opened as on any call and not read: the call is up once it opens
 * and over once it closes, as the Codex CLI's voice client holds it (codex-rs
 * voice-host transport.rs, `oai-events`).
