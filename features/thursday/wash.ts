// cell — and it comes out again by deleting this and the lines in ascii-orb that call it.
//
// It is not a band crossing her and it is not a change of colour: the glyphs themselves change,
// in a patch that spreads. It starts at a few points, grows out of them behind a front made of
// noise, sits a while, and lets go in a different order than it came. Inside the reach only some
// cells are taken, fewer the further from where it started, so it reads as something spreading
// rather than as a shape being painted on.
