 * which open it on the list of who to write to, or a file dragged onto the window — and it
 * holds who it is for, the words, and the files. Files are kept in the workspace the moment
 * they arrive (given-files), so they wait here by path until words go with them. Sent to a
 * bot, the room opens on the thread it started. Sent to Thursday — who it opens on until
 * someone else is picked — it becomes a call in writing (use-text-call): the line stays up
 * as that call's way in, says what the call runs on, and Esc ends the call rather than
 * closing the line. A bot can still be picked during it, for one message; then the line is
 * hers again. Its paperclip offers a file from this computer or a drawing (draw-pad), which the line holds
 * for the call's line too (writeLine.draw): a drawing arrives as a pasted picture does, but on
 * a spoken call, where it goes to her alone and she answers it (screen-act `showed`).
