 * Thursday wherever she is small: the room, a thread, the call log, the
 * settings nav. Every screen draws her through this one component, so giving
 * her another icon is a change to this file. The browser tab is the exception:
 * it keeps the mark drawn from THURSDAY_SEED (tab-state).
 *
 * It is the call's orb in miniature and keeps its rules. Glyphs have one size,
 * so a bigger box holds more of them, not bigger ones; cells sit on a grid and
 * never touch; the rim is crumbly; past a few cells some are missing, more
 * toward the rim. Nothing fades: a cell moves by taking another glyph. SVG so
 * callers can size it with classes.
