// Her eyes. One file, because the whole feature is here: the shape, what it does while it is up,
// and the test a renderer asks per cell. The call's orb uses it, and it can come out again by
// deleting this and the lines there that call it.
//
// The shape is the bot faces' own (features/bot/components/bot-mark: eyeLen 51, eyeWidth 38,
// eyeBend -1, eyeTaper 0.35, eyeTilt -90 so the length runs up the face, eyeGap 88, eyeY 100
// against a centre of 120, in a body of radius 112). One scale carries all of it to any size, which
// is the point: the eyes that open in the intro's star are the ones that open in the small face.
//
// Two things a mark does not need. The lid does the opening and the closing — the lens grows from
// a slit and goes back to one — because a hole that fills itself in cell by cell is something
// appearing, and one that fills itself back in is something dissolving; neither is what an eye
// does. The cell noise is still there, but only for the third of a second the lid is moving: the
// outline itself never wobbles, since at the call's size an eye is about eight cells across and
// an outline that moves by a cell and a half stops being an eye.
//
// How a face wears the pair is an EyeFit, and it is two numbers, not one. Making the lens big
// enough to read as a hole in a body of glyphs used to push the pair apart and up with it, which
// is what made the proportions wrong: the layout is the mark's, and only the lens grows.
