 * opens with the first words and closes when the call ends — Esc in the line, or a spoken
 * call taking the screen. She holds no tool that ends it: there is no line to drop.
 *
 * A chat has no line to talk over, so nothing here waits for quiet. What is written while
 * she answers joins that answer before her next step (thursday.text tellTextCall), and what
 * came after her last step starts the next turn at once. What bots send is left to her as a
 * fact the moment the inbox has it: into the answer she is writing, or as a turn of its own
 * when she is not writing one — never after a turn that broke, which keeps its error and its
 * Send it again, and at most TEXT_CALL.autoTurns in a row with no word from the user. What
 * the user does on screen is a fact as well, and waits for her next step without starting
 * one. All go as notes (`data-note` parts): words drawn as the user's, facts not drawn at
 * all, and a bot's relay rows accepted once a turn that carried its fact has finished. Send
 * it again keeps what the broken answer finished — a tool it ran is not run twice — and
 * does the rest again.
