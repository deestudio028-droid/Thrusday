/**
 * What the pill's write button becomes while the line it opens is up: smoke in a glass, carried
 * left to right. It keeps the button's box, so the pill is the same width either way.
 *
 * Drawn to frames the user brought, and measured off them rather than guessed:
 *   · one hue throughout — the blue channel never leaves 247..254 while red and green run
 *     110..252 — so every pixel is that blue with some amount of white in it;
 *   · the picture is mostly PALE: median red 219, only a tenth under 145. One soft dark mass and
 *     three quarters of it light; half and half reads as a wave;
 *   · the ramps between are long, and a long ramp is a wide window over a big slow field;
 *   · a row across the middle is nearly flat and a column is not, so the smoke lies in banks
 *     stretched sideways;
 *   · the edge lands in two pixels, so the circle is cut, not faded — which the button's own
 *     `rounded-full overflow-hidden` does, at the screen's resolution rather than the buffer's.
 *
 * Four things were tried and are wrong, kept here so they are not tried again: one field sliding
 * past reads as a camera moving over something standing still; crossfading two phases of one
 * field reads as growing and shrinking in place; a twist strongest in the middle draws a taegeuk;
 * and a scale under about 0.5 puts the whole disc inside one cell of noise, where it brightens
 * and darkens as one lump instead of having weather in it.
 */

/**
 * The one hue, deepest first: three smoke tones between the ink and the paper. The steps are
 * walked from the app's own blue (`--brand` #0169cc) at the distances read off the frames, so
 * the smoke is the app's colour and only the hue differs from what was measured.
