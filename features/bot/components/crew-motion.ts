/**
 * The crew's body language: what a face does when something happens to the bot behind it.
 *
 * At rest every face breathes and nothing else moves. A gesture then plays ONCE, on the ONE face
 * the event belongs to, over the breath — so the pill says what happened where it happened,
 * instead of leaving it to the bubble that only has room for one thing at a time.
 *
 * A jump reads as weight only when the body and the shape run on different curves, so a face is a
 * stack of layers (room-pill `Crew`) and a gesture names which of them it takes: `body` moves it
 * through the air, `shape` presses and flattens it, `turn` rotates it. A layer a gesture does not
 * name keeps doing what it was: the shape layer goes back to breathing.
 *
 * The keyframes are in `app/globals.css`; every duration here is the length that file cuts them to.
