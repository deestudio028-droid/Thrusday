- **What is already true.** Every value you have — numbers, names, dates, ids, urls, prices, times — written out, not referred to. A value you leave out is one the next steps go and fetch again.
- **Where you are.** Which page the browser is on by url, whether you are signed in and to what, what is running, what you were in the middle of. Element refs do not survive this: name what to look for, never a ref.
- **Files.** Every path you wrote or read, and one line on what each holds.
- **What did not work**, and why: the url that 404s, the endpoint that needs POST not GET, the selector that is not there, the site that refuses a headless browser, the argument a tool rejected. This is the part that stops the next steps repeating an hour of yours.
- **What is left**, in the order you would do it.
