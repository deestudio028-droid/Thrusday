 * (skills/artifact/runtime/deck). Nothing about how a slide looks is the model's to get wrong — sizes,
 * colours, where a heading sits, what happens to words that do not fit — so a deck comes
 * out right from any model that can fill a schema. The file holds the deck as data and
 * draws itself from it, and a change sends the whole deck again, checked against the
 * revision the file names so a change never lands on a deck its writer has not seen.
 *
 * The character caps are sized for the drawing in skills/artifact/runtime/deck/deck.css: what fits a slide
 * at full size. Past them the type would shrink too far, and a slide would be a page.
