/**
 * A bot's own line: a few words the roster reads after the description the user wrote (bot.schema
 * rosterLine), where Thursday and every other bot pick who gets a job. The description stays the
 * user's; a bot whose work has changed for good — a skill of its own, what the user told it it is
 * for, the jobs that keep coming to it — says so here, so it is the one picked for them. A line
 * rewritten after every job would move the roster under every call, so the tool says to use it
 * rarely and why. The line it wrote before is named in the description, since the prompt shows
 * both halves as one. Left out of the set for a bot the user locked (botTable descriptionLocked)
 * and for the fallback that has no row.
