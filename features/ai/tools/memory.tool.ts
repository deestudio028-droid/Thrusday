 * @param callId The call these tools serve, when there is one: recorded on
 * what is written, so a fact reads with when it was said.
 * @param options.countReads Whether opening a note counts as reading it. The
 * counts rank notes cold in the call prompt, so only a runtime that recalls on
 * the user's behalf counts; an edit opening a note to change it does not.
 * @param options.tidies Whether the holder can settle an overgrown note with the

 * told to, it had nothing to delete with and the user was asked mid-job.
