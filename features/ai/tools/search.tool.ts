 * model's native search, one call down on a searcher that sees nothing but the question — a
 * provider tool cannot be handed to another provider's model, names and result shapes differ
 * per provider, and Google cannot send its search tool alongside function tools in one request.
 *
 * A run whose model has no search of its own (the gateway) and no Exa key gets no search tool:
 * it goes to the browser. Borrowing whichever provider had a key meant a second model call on a
 * model nobody picked, which is where the minute-long searches came from — search is one lookup
 * or it is a job, and a job is what the browser already is.
