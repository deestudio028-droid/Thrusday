const SHELL_GUIDE = `## The shell here

Every command is a new shell: \`cd\`, exported variables and an activated venv are gone by the next one — chain what depends on the last step into a single command.

Nothing is watching it. A command that stops to ask never gets an answer and is killed after ${EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS / 1000}s, so pass the flag that skips the question (\`-y\`, \`--yes\`, \`--no-input\`), and send anything genuinely long to the background with its output redirected to a file.

Keys are not in the environment: every variable named like a key, a token or a secret is removed before the shell starts. An empty one is not an unset one — say which it was, and ask for what a command needs.`;
