/**
 * How hard a model is set to think: the steps that model takes, as one button group beside the
 * model it belongs to. A step is a value to pick, like every other `Segmented` here, so the one
 * set is the brand's.
 *
 * `auto` is not one of the steps — it sets nothing and leaves the model to decide, which is a
 * different kind of answer from `none` ("do not think") — so it leads the group rather than
 * sitting in the ladder's order.
 *
 * A model whose ladder nobody knows offers `auto` alone: a step a provider hands straight to its
 * API fails the whole call, so it is never offered on a guess (ai/model runEffort drops it too).
 * A model picked while a step is set takes the step with it where its own ladder holds it, and
 * gives it up where it does not — one place, so every screen that sets one behaves the same.
