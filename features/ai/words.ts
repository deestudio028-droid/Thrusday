/**
 * A stretch of conversation as its words alone: what was said, and for a step that only
 * used tools, what it did, in the caller's wording (`did`). What a tool answered and what
 * the model thought are most of what a transcript weighs, and they go.
 *
 * The words are rebuilt as plain messages rather than pruned in place (ai `pruneMessages`).
 * A provider ties a thought to the item it led to, by id, and refuses the whole
 * conversation when one arrives without the other: a thought whose tool call was pruned,
 * or words whose thought was. A plain message carries no id, so nothing is left to pair.
 * The steps of one reply come back as one message, since some providers want the
 * speakers to take turns.
