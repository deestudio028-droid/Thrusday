/**
 * Thursday from a phone. The server connects outward to a chat service the user set up —
 * their own bot on Telegram, Discord or Slack, or a mailbox of hers, nothing opened to the
 * outside — and answers
 * with the backend a call in writing runs (thursday.text): same prompt, memory, tools and
 * rows, so it is a call like any other, held here instead of by a page. One person may
 * write through each service, and the screen is where they are let in: someone who can
 * write to her can, through her, run things on this computer.
 *
 * A turn is what they wrote and what she answered; work she handed over comes back later,
 * by itself. It comes as the bot wrote it, with its files, and no turn of hers is spent
 * saying it again — she is left a fact, so what is written back lands where she can route
 * it, and a question's options go as buttons that answer the bot directly. What they write
 * while she is still working joins that turn rather than waiting for one of its own.
 *
 * Who she is and what she may do is the app's, kept where a call reads it
 * (thursday.query readLiveSettings), so the person here meets the same Thursday the
 * screen does. What stays in a browser is how that machine talks to her, which a chat
 * has no use for.
