 * write is named on the screen (`named`), and a mail reaches her only once the sender's own
 * mail service vouches for it: DMARC passes on a signature of that domain (mailauth), checked
 * here rather than taken from a header the receiving service wrote. It must also be written to
 * her address and be recent (REACH.mailFreshMs) — an old mail of theirs, still signed, could
 * otherwise be sent to her again by anyone it once went to. The inbox is only read: nothing in
